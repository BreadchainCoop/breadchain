/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```solidity
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * @dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP-712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.
 *
 * The encoding scheme specified in the EIP requires a domain separator and a hash of the typed structured data, whose
 * encoding is very generic and therefore its implementation in Solidity is not feasible, thus this contract
 * does not implement the encoding itself. Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to
 * produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.
 *
 * This contract implements the EIP-712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding
 * scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA
 * ({_hashTypedDataV4}).
 *
 * The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating
 * the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as "v4", as implemented by the JSON RPC method
 * https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].
 *
 * NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain
 * separator of the implementation contract. This will cause the {_domainSeparatorV4} function to always rebuild the
 * separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage.

/**
 * @dev This is a base abstract contract that tracks voting units, which are a measure of voting power that can be
 * transferred, and provides a system of vote delegation, where an account can delegate its voting units to a sort of
 * "representative" that will pool delegated voting units from different accounts and can then use it to vote in
 * decisions. In fact, voting units _must_ be delegated in order to count as actual votes, and an account has to
 * delegate those votes to itself if it wishes to participate in decisions and does not have a trusted representative.
 *
 * This contract is often combined with a token contract such that voting units correspond to token units. For an
 * example, see {ERC721Votes}.
 *
 * The full history of delegate votes is tracked on-chain so that governance protocols can consider votes as distributed
 * at a particular block number to protect against flash loans and double voting. The opt-in delegate system makes the
 * cost of this history tracking optional.
 *
 * When using this module the derived contract must implement {_getVotingUnits} (for example, make it return
 * {ERC721-balanceOf}), and can use {_transferVotingUnits} to track a change in the distribution of those units (in the
 * previous example, it would be included in {ERC721-_update}).

 *
 * NOTE: This contract does not provide interface compatibility with Compound's COMP token.
 *
 * This extension keeps a history (checkpoints) of each account's vote power. Vote power can be delegated either
 * by calling the {Votes-delegate} function directly, or by providing a signature to be used with {Votes-delegateBySig}. Voting
 * power can be queried through the public accessors {Votes-getVotes} and {Votes-getPastVotes}.
 *
 * By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it
 * requires users to delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.
